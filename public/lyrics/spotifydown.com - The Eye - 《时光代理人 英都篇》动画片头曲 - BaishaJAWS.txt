I wish that I could tell you the truth
我多想把真相告訴你
I've seen it a million times
我已經見證了太多次
I stopped painting excuses red
我不再在乎那些藉口
Even if I'm trapped in a rewind
即使我被困在了倒帶中
Rewinding right in front of the eye
在英都眼前回溯
I ran towards the end of line
我奔向盡頭
I heard your voice but missed you in time
聽到了你的聲音卻還是錯過
I followed every end of the signs
我追隨了路標的每個方向
But the clock tower bell only struck nine
但是塔樓上的鐘只敲了九下
When the sun sets on this side of my mind
當太陽在我腦海的這一側沉沒
And I thought it was snowing
我還以為天開始下雪了
Only when the ashes fell on the film in my hands
直到灰燼飄落在我手中的底片上
Did I know
我才明白
There will be a fire when it all unfolds
烈火會在一切開始時燃燒
We should bury the treasure along with all we know
我們應將珍惜和所知的一切埋入地下
But I couldn't save you
但我還是無法拯救你
I couldn't make it to you
無法趕到你身邊
Trapped in endings I don't want you to know
永遠困在那些我不想讓你知道的結局裡
So long to a bursting wave of blinding lights
告別了這突然閃爍的耀眼光芒
But we fought the tides we fought the tides
我們勇鬥了那些驚濤駭浪
Till the river dried
直到河流乾涸
We splash velvet dye in the sky
我們將粉紫色的燃料撒向天空
Standing still in front of the eye
堅定佇立在英都眼前
I still remember the way you danced under heavy rain
我還記得你在驟雨中的舞姿
Hold out your hands and embraced
你將雙手舉起擁抱天空
When clouds never seemed to fade away away away away
即使雲層似乎永遠不會消散
Rolling thunders in disguise
在僞裝中捲起層層雷電
No matter how hard we looked in the lost and found
無論我們在失物招領中如何努力尋找
We never could shine the moonlight underground
我們都無法將潔白的月光灑入地底
To the point where we got sick of pretending 
like we are saviors
直到我們真的受夠了繼續扮演拯救者們的角色
Till we learn to carry on
直到我們學會釋然
There will be a fire when it all unfolds
烈火會在一切開始時燃燒
We should bury the treasure along with all we know
我們應將珍惜和所知的一切埋入地下
But I couldn't save you
但我還是無法拯救你
I couldn't make it to you
無法趕到你身邊
Trapped in endings I don't want you to know
永遠困在那些我不想讓你知道的結局裡
So long to a bursting wave of blinding lights
告別了這突然閃爍的耀眼光芒
But we fought the tides we fought the tides
我們勇鬥了那些驚濤駭浪
Till the river dried
直到河流乾涸
We splash velvet dye in the sky
我們將粉紫色的燃料撒向天空
Standing still in front of the eye
堅定佇立在英都眼前
So the clock tower bell only struck nine
塔樓的鐘聲只敲了九下
And we followed every end of the signs
我們已經追尋了路標的每個方向
If I heard your voice and caught you in time
如果我聽到了你的聲音並且追上了你
Are you with me to the end of the line?
你會和我一起直到最後嗎？
Are you with me to the end of the line
你會和我一起直到最後嗎？
Are you with me to the end of the line
你會和我一起直到最後嗎？
Are you with me to the end of the line
你會和我一起直到最後嗎？
Are you with me?
你會和我一起嗎？
