Baby you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer...
I've been on my own, yeah
Okay, it's been a week, I think it's overrated
I'm tired of the break, okay I maybe hate it
I kinda just miss you
You got me in my zone, yeah
You got me in feelings and I feel frustrated
I'm not that good at cookin', got my windows shaded
I kinda just miss you
And all those
Ten mile road trips, baby you're the best
You're a ten times ten times ten, and I'm blessed
So let's ride 'til it's over
On this high 'til October
And we might just be sober
But with you I don't mind because
Baby you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o'clock is just the time to get the summer started, oh, yeah
Baby you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're wading in a summer tide
If you want it girl I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o'clock is just the time to get the summer started
Every single time
I'm lying in my bed, I got you on my mind
The way we toss and turn at least 100 times and
I still kinda miss you, uh
So send me out a sign
I'm over saturated with a cheap tan line
The park is kinda lame without your taste for wine and yeah
I still kinda miss all the things that we do
Like
Ten mile road trips, baby you're the best
You're a ten times ten times ten, and I'm blessed
So let's ride 'til it's over
On this high 'til October
And we might just be sober
But with you I don't mind because
Baby you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o'clock is just the time to get the summer started, oh
And I know I said that we should hang out next week
But oh, since then I find it hard to get sleep
So if you don't mind
That I'm asking
How 'bout tonight?
Because
Baby you're my summer vibe
Take your picture while we're bathing in the summer light
If you want it girl, I got it
Two's enough to party
Three o'clock is just the time to get this funky summer party started
Baby you're my summer vibe, yeah, uh
Baby you're my summer vibe...
Baby you're my summer vibe, heh
Baby you're my summer vibe
